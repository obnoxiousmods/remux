# Remux playback verification harness

A standalone, re-runnable tool that **proves** the server actually serves a
*decodable audio stream* for a track — not merely a `200` — and that albums and
playlists resolve every child to a playable source. It is the regression gate for
music playback.

## What it checks (per track)

Walking the real client flow:

1. `POST /Items/{id}/PlaybackInfo` → pick a MediaSource + PlaySessionId, and
   sanity-check its shape (`Protocol`, `IsRemote`, `Container`, an `Audio`
   MediaStream, direct-play/transcode support).
2. Fetch the stream three ways with a `Range` header, asserting `200/206` + an
   `audio/*` Content-Type + non-empty body:
   - `/Audio/{id}/universal` — **and asserts it does not redirect into the video
     HLS pipeline** (`/videos/{id}/master.m3u8`). That regression made every audio
     track hand a music client a *video* manifest; this check locks the fix in.
   - `/Audio/{id}/stream?static=true`
   - `/Items/{id}/File`
3. `--deep` (implicit for `--item`): download the whole stream and decode it with
   `ffmpeg -f null -` — proving the bytes are a valid, fully decodable audio file,
   and reporting codec / sample-rate / channels / duration.

Exit code is non-zero on any hard failure, so it works as a CI/regression gate.

## Usage

```sh
# one track, deep decode test
python3 verify.py --item <track-id>

# every track on an album / every member of a playlist
python3 verify.py --album <album-id>
python3 verify.py --playlist <playlist-id> [--limit N]

# a random library sample, or an explicit id list ("<id>|<name>" per line)
python3 verify.py --sample 40
python3 verify.py --idfile local_ids.txt
```

Config via env (`REMUX_BASE`, `REMUX_TOKEN`, `REMUX_UID`, `REMUX_DB`); defaults
target the local server.

## Findings it has proven (2026-07-16)

- **`/Audio/{id}/universal` redirected audio into the video pipeline**
  (`→ /videos/{id}/master.m3u8?VideoCodec=copy&AudioCodec=aac`), so a music client
  received a 192-byte video HLS manifest for an audio-only track. Fixed to redirect
  to the range-capable direct audio stream. *(playback.rs::audio_universal)*
- **Single-item `/Items/{id}` mislabeled every local track** as `Protocol:Http` /
  `IsRemote:true` with a video transcoding URL (the unconditional Track wrap in
  `item()`); local files now serve a direct `File` source, matching the batch path
  and PlaybackInfo. *(items.rs)*
- After both fixes: the Hayley Williams album is **19/19**, a 40-track random local
  sample is **40/40**, all decode-verified.

## Streaming→local healing (implemented)

The `car time` playlist is **entirely streaming-backed** (Deezer rows); at test time
~27% failed because the signed upstream URL was dead (`410`) or the track was gone
upstream (empty `PlaybackInfo`). **111 of its 133 members have an identical local
file.** The opendal-local addon now matches a streaming track to a local copy strictly
on **title + album + artist** (against the reliable `media` table, single unambiguous
candidate only) and serves the local file — it is a primary provider, so the reliable
local copy wins. Result: `car time` went **97/133 → 125/133**, all healed tracks
decode-verified, zero regressions. The 8 residual failures have no local copy (gone
upstream) or point at a since-deleted file (stale index). See
`MUSIC-CLIENT-COMPAT-AUDIT.md` and `crates/remux-server/src/addons/opendal.rs`.

## Apple LL-HLS prototype

`mediamtx-llhls-prototype.yml` is a loopback-only packager configuration for
testing true Apple LL-HLS without changing the production HLS routes. FFmpeg
publishes H.264/AAC over RTSP and MediaMTX emits one-second CMAF segments split
into 200 ms parts.

The intended production boundary is:

- Remux owns authentication, `PlaySessionId`, source selection, seek offsets,
  source stickiness, publisher lifetime, and recovery.
- FFmpeg publishes one RTSP path per `PlaySessionId`.
- MediaMTX only packages that publisher into Apple LL-HLS.
- Remux proxies and rewrites the playlists and CMAF assets; MediaMTX remains
  unreachable outside loopback.

Do not enable this path for VOD until Remux exposes the full episode timeline
and translates an out-of-window seek into an accurate same-source FFmpeg
restart. MediaMTX's native playlist is a sliding live window, so serving it
directly would regress long-seek behavior even though startup is faster.

The initial 1280x720 H.264/AAC synthetic cold-start proof on this host produced
the master playlist at 614 ms, listed the first 200 ms part at 630 ms, and
successfully fetched it at 639 ms. These numbers isolate local encode and
packaging overhead; remote source open time still has to be measured separately.
